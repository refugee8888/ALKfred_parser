      "A phase-3 clinical trial evaluated 347 patients with ALK-positive lung cancer.  The study compared crizotinib treatment (n=173) with chemotherapy treatment of either pemetrexed or docetaxel (n=174).  In the crizotinib arm, the response rate was significantly higher (65% vs 20%; P<0.001), the progression-free survival was increased (7.7 months vs. 3.0 months; HR=0.49, 95%CI:14 months-26 months; p<0.001), however, there was no significant improvement in overall survival (HR=1.02; 95%CI:0.68-1.54; P=0.54).  Of the patients on crizotinib treatment, global quality of life was improved relative to baseline when compared to chemotherapy patients (+5 mean change, -5 mean change; P<0.001).",
      "A randomized phase 3 trial (J-ALEX) of 207 Japanese ALK-positive NSCLC patients compared the efficacy and safety of alectinib (300mg twice daily) and crizotinib (250mg twice daily) in the first-line setting. When used as a first line treatment the median progression-free survival of the alectinib group was unreached (95% CI 17.5\u2013not estimated) versus 10.2 months (95% CI 8.3\u201313.9) in the crizotinib group (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17\u20130\u00b757). In the overall intent to treat population, Alectinib showed improved median PFS (HR 0.34; 99.7% CI 0.17-0.71; stratified log-rank p<0\u00b70001) with an unreached PFS (95% CI 20.3-not estimated) compared to 10.2 months (95% CI 8.2-12.0) for crizotinib. The safety profile of alectinib was favorable relative to crizotinib with fewer dose interruptions (29% vs 74%) and fewer grade 3-4 adverse events (26% vs 52%).",
      "Among 95 patients with NSCLC in this study, 15 had an ALK translocation. ORR of these patients compared to EGFR mutated or wild-type tumors was superior (46.7 versus 4.7 versus 16.2%, p = 0.001). TYMS expression was lower in ALK-positive cells.",
      "In a phase 2 trial, patients with NSCLC with ALK fusion received lorlatinib.\nIn treatment-naive patients, ORR was 90.0% In patients with at least one previous ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ORR were achieved in 47.0%.In patients who had only received crizotinib ORR was achieved in 69.5%.",
      "In a phase 3 trial, 303 patients with NSCLC with ALK fusion were randomly assigned to alectinib arm (N=152) or crizotinib arm (N=151). PFS was significantly longer with alectinib than with crizotinib (HR for disease progression or death 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.65, p<0.001). Investigator-assessed RR was 82.9% in alectinib arm and 75.5% in crizotinib arm. CNS RR in patients with measurable CNS lesions was 81% and 50% for alectinib and crizotinib, respectively. Eight patients in the alectinib group, in comparison to one patient with crizotinib, had a complete CNS response. Despite longer treatment duration for alectinib, there were fewer grade 3-5 adverse events compared with crizotinib treatment.",
      "In a phase 3 trial, patients with previously treatmented NSCLC with ALK fusion were randomly assigned to ceritinib or chemotherapy.\nCeritinib showed a significant improvement in median  PFS compared with chemotherapy (5\u00b74 months [95% CI 4\u00b71-6\u00b79] for ceritinib vs 1\u00b76 months [1\u00b74-2\u00b78] for chemotherapy; hazard ratio 0\u00b749 [0\u00b736-0\u00b767]; p<0\u00b70001).",
      "In a phase II randomized trial we evaluated two regimens of Brigatinib in Crizotinib-refractory ALK-pos. NSCLC. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to oral Brigatinib 90 mg once daily (arm A) or 180 mg once daily with a 7-day lead-in at 90 mg. Of 222 patients enrolled (arm A: n = 112, arm B: n = 110), 154 (69%) had baseline brain metastases and 164 of 222 (74%) had received prior chemotherapy. ORR was 45 (arm A) and 54% (B). Investigator-assessed median PFS was 9.2 months (A) and 12.9 months (B). Independent review committee-assessed intracranial ORR in patients with measurable brain metastases at baseline was 42% (11/26, A) and 67% (12/18, B). Brigatinib yielded substantial whole-body and intracranial responses as well as robust PFS; 180 mg (with lead-in) showed consistently better efficacy than 90 mg, with acceptable safety.",
      "In a randomized, open-label phase 3 trial 303 patients with ALK-positive, previously untreated NSCLC (including asympt. CNS disease) were randomized to reiceive either Alectinib or Crizotinib. During a median follow-up of 17.6 months (crizotinib) and 18.6 months (alectinib), an event of disease progression/death occurred in 41% (62/152  pt) in the alectinib group and 68% (102/151 patients) in the crizotinib group. 12-month event-free survival rate 68.4% with alectinib vs. 48.7% with crizotinib. A total of 18 patients (12%) in the alectinib group had an event of CNS progression, compared to 68 patients (45%) in the crizotinib group. Response rates were 82.9% (Alectinib) and 75.5% (crizotinib).",
      "In a retrospective study comparing survival outcomes in a subgroup of 82 ALK-positive crizotinib-treated patients enrolled in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT00585195), crizotinib therapy was associated with improved survival. For the crizotinib-treated, ALK-positive patient group, 1 year survival was 74% and 2 year overall survival was 54%, compared with 72% and 36% for the control group (ALK-positive crizotinib naive patients).",
      "In the Phase I study PROFILE 1001 (NCT00585195), a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily for 28 day cycles was established. Among 1,500 advanced NSCLC patients who were screened for ALK-rearrangement using a break-apart FISH assay, 82 patients were eligible for crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response. Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition. 31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen. 9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances.",
      "In this Phase I trial (NCT01588028) in 47 patients, alectinib was assessed for its effectiveness in treating locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC that had progressed or been resistant to crizotinib treatment. ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), ten were assessable, and there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease. Also, five of nine patients throughout the cohorts with measurable baseline CNS lesions showed partial response to alectinib. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alectinib increased linearly with blood alectinib levels, indicating it effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In this Phase II trial of 87 patients (NCT01871805), alectinib was assayed for safety and efficacy in ALK positive NSCLC that had progressed on crizotinib. Of 69 patients with measurable disease, 35 achieved objective response, with median duration of response 13.5 months. Of 16 patients with measurable CNS disease, four achieved CNS complete response and 8 showed CNS partial response. median duration of CNS response was 11.1 months. 2 deaths were observed, and 1 was judged related to study treatment.",
      "In this case study of a critically ill 29 year old male nonsmoker with advanced metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC, alectinib (CH5424802), was administered as first line treatment. Where most clinical trials only admit patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, this patient had PS 4 due to respiratory failure, multiple bone metastases and complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Administration of alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was followed by marked improvement seen in tests associated with DIC, pulmonary metastasis and change in PS from 4 to 0. Further improvements after a couple of months suggested a rapid complete response. Alectinib was well tolerated in this first line treatment of a critically ill ALK-positive NSCLC patient.",
      "In this global phase 3 trial, 257 patients with ALK-positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer were treated with either alectinib (n = 130) or chemotherapy (n = 127). 93.8 % of the patients who had received alectinib versus 63% who were in the chemotherapy group were alive and disease-free at 2 years. A hazard ratio of 0.24 (95% CI; 0.13 - 0.43, p < 0.001) was reported for disease recurrence or death, which implies a 76% lower risk with adjuvant alectinib than chemotherapy. 98.4% of the patients in the alectinib group, and 93.3% of the patients in the chemotherapy group reported at least one adverse event. Serious adverse events were reported in 13.3% of the patients in the alectinib group compared to 8.3% of the patients in the chemotherapy group. Overall, the study found improved disease-free survival in the alectinib group compared to the chemotherapy group.",
      "In this initial report of a single-arm Phase I and II study (JapicCTI-101264) of alectinib (CH5424802), 46 patients with advanced or metastatic ALK-rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assessed for objective response during phase II. ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.",
      "In this study, heavily pretreated advanced NSCLC patients with various molecular tumor makeup were treated with Hsp90 inhibitor IPI-504 to assess overall response rate. The study did not reach the targeted endpoint of 20% ORR. However, of 3/12 patients found to be ALK-rearranged via break apart FISH assay, 2 showed a partial response and the third stable disease, which was durable for 7.2 months. The authors note that the break apart FISH assay used to determine ALK-rearrangement status does not determine the identity of the ALK fusion partner and the promising results shown here may be dependent on the nature of the ALK fusion partner.",
      "The phase III ALTA-1L open-label randomized trial examined 275 NSCLC patients given brigatinib (137 patients) vs crizotinib (138 patients).  Patients were ALK fusion positive by an FDA-approved diagnostic test and had not previously received ALK inhibitors. Brigatinib showed superior PFS compared to crizotinib (HR 0.49 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.68]; log-rank P < .0001; median, 24.0 v 11.0 months). Initial results from this trial were previously reported in 2018 (PMID: 30280657).",
      "This phase 3 trial named PROFILE 1014 (NCT01154140) compared crizotinib to established chemotherapy in first-line treatment for this disease. The study consisted of 343 patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC that tested positive for ALK rearrangement via break-apart FISH assay, and had no prior systemic treatment. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to crizotinib (N=172) or pemetrexed with cisplatin or carboplatin (N=171). Progression free survival was significantly longer with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (10.9 vs. 7.0 months; hazard ratio for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.60;P<0.001), and objective response rate was higher with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (75% vs. 45%, P<0.001). Improvement in quality of life was also reported.",
      "This prospective Phase III study named Profile 1014 on NSCLC ALK-rearranged patients assessed intracranial disease control rate (IC-DCR) in the subset of patients entering the study with preexisting treated brain metastasis (tBM). IC-DCR was significantly improved in the tBM group given crizotinib (N=39) over chemotherapy (pemetrexed + cisplatin or carboplatin; N=40) at 12 weeks (85% vs. 45%, P<0.001), and at 24 weeks (56% vs. 25%, P=0.006). Progression free survival was also significantly improved with crizotinib over chemotherapy in the tBM subgroup (9.0 vs. 4.0 months; HR 0.40; P<0.001), where in the intent to treat population it was 10.9 vs. 7.0 months (HR 0.45; P<0.001), indicating that the difficult to treat BM population obtained benefit from crizotinib at both the brain and systemic level.",
      "This retrospective study of patients from the PROFILE 1001 and 1005 studies of crizotinib in advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC assessed the potential benefit of crizotinib beyond progressive disease (CBPD), defined as continuation of crizotinib for 3 or more weeks after disease progression on crizotinib. 194 patients who had developed PD by data cutoff were studied, where 120 received crizotinib for a median duration of 19.4 weeks and 74 discontinued crizotinib after PD. No gross imbalances in clinicopathologic features of the two groups were evident.  Significantly longer overall survival was observed in the crizotinib continuing group from time of PD (16.4 vs. 3.9 months; hazard ratio 0.27, 95% CI: 0.17\u20130.42; P < 0.0001), and from the time of initial crizotinib (29.6 vs. 10.8 months; HR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.19\u20130.46; P < 0.0001).",
      "This two arm Phase III study named PROFILE 1007 (NCT00932893) was performed to assess crizotinib vs. established chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients positive for ALK rearrangement (assessed by break-apart FISH) with locally advanced or metastatic disease. 347 patients with disease progression after one round of platinum-based chemotherapy were randomized to receive crizotinib (N=173) or chemotherapy (N=174) consisting of pemetrexed in pemetrexed-naive patients and docetaxel for patients previously treated with pemetrexed. The primary endpoint - progression free survival (PFS) - was found to be significantly better for patients treated with crizotinib (median 7.7 months) than with chemotherapy (median 3.0 months) (hazard ratio for disease progression or death with crizotinib, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.64; P<0.001). Response rates were 65% for crizotinib treatment and 20% for chemotherapy (P<0.001). Improvements in quality of life were also reported.",
      "Updated results from ASCEND-1 trial assessing safety and activity of ceritinib in ALK rearranged locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. 255 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of ceritinib 750 mg/day, of whom 246 had ALK-rearranged NSCLC (Median follow-up: 11.1 months). Overall response rate was 72% [95% CI 61-82] of 83 ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 56% [49-64] of 163 ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Median duration of response was 17\u00b70 months (95% CI 11.3-non-estimable [NE]) in ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 8.3 months (6.8-9.7) in ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Median progression-free survival was 18.4 months (95% CI 11.1-NE) in ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 6.9 months (5.6-8.7) in ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Brain metastases control was reported in 79% [95% CI 54-94] of 19 ALK inhibitor-naive patients and in 65% [54-76] of 75 ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients."

After initiation of crizotinib, PET, CT and bone marrow aspirates showed complete remission of previous lesions at 28 days. At time of publication the patient continued to show persistent response at 6 months. A 20 year old patient relapsed after one month of CHOP, and was treated with further chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation resulting in partial response of 1 month. Crizotinib was initialized, and after 12 days PET scan showed complete regression of all lesions. On day 60 bone marrow aspirates were ALK-negative (pretreatment evaluation showed 8% ALK-positive).

      "NPM-ALK in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) was the first ALK-fusion to be discovered and characterized.  In this study, targeted activity against NPM-ALK by the ALK and MET inhibitor crizotinib was assessed in cell lines and tumor xenograft models. Treatment of NPM-ALK positive ALCL cell lines Karpas299 and SU-DHL-1 potently inhibited growth, and this was seen to occur at concentrations which also inhibited NPM-ALK phosphorylation in these cells. Administration of 100mg/kg/d crizotinib resulted in complete regression of all tumors, indicating that NPM-ALK could be an effective target for crizotinib in ALCL."

EML4-ALK T1151insT was expressed In Ba/F3 cells and an IC50 of 431.8 nM was obtained, which was 16 times higher than for EML4-ALK wild-type, indicating strong crizotinib resistance. EML4-ALK containing H3122 NSCLC cells were incubated in increasing levels of crizotinib inducing resistance. The resulting cell line H3122 CR2 had IC50 10x greater to crizotinib than parental H3122, and was found to contain 1151 insT mutation. In western blots, pALK levels in H3122 CR2 cells remained apparent under 1000 nM crizotinib, whereas pALK signal was ablated under these conditions in parental H3122 cells.",

Crizotinib resistant clones were produced from the parental EML4-ALK variant 1 containing cell line H3122 (CR1, CR2, CR3). H3122 CR2 was found to contain the EML4-ALK InsT variant.

      "Treatment of Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK 1151 insT with TAE684 produced an IC50 value (28.3 nM) 20x higher cells expressing EML4-ALK wildtype variant 1. The crizotinib resistant clones were produced from parental H3122 cells (CR1, CR2, CR3). H3122 CR2 was found to contain the 1151 Tins variant as well as elevated EML4-ALK expression. H3122 CR2 cells treated with TAE684 produced IC50 values 20-30 times that of the parental H3122 cells. These results suggest possible variant resistance to the TAE684-derived compound ceritinib."

      "This study analyzed patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were positive for EML4-ALK fusions (ALK+) and progressed on crizotinib monotherapy. One ALK+ patient harbored the common E6;A20 fusion with ALK G1269A co-mutation in post-crizotinib progression biopsies. The presence of ALK G1269A pre-crizotinib could not be evaluated. This patient was a 21 year old non-smoking male with adenocarcinoma, wt for KRAS and EGFR, negative for ALK copy number gain, who experienced crizotinib as a 2nd line therapy. The patient's best response on crizotinib was stable disease (377 days on treatment). In vitro, Ba/F3 cell line expressing EML4-ALK fusion (E6a;A20, a known sensitizing alteration) and ALK G1269A co-mutation demonstrated resistance to crizotinib treatment (341 nmol/L vs. 22 nmol/L) compared to Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK fusion. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability and colony formation. Levels of phosphorylation of ALK, ERK, STAT3, and AKT were higher in ALK+ G1269A mutant cells than ALK+ controls, by western blot. The authors note that ALK G1269A likely induces resistance by preventing crizotinib from accessing its binding pocket in the ALK kinase domain."

The authors suggest that the type/structure of ALK fusion may have some impact on patient outcome in targeted therapy.",
      "Ceritinib was 28x more potent (GI50 3.8nM) than crizotinib (GI50 107nM) at inhibiting growth of  H2228, an NSCLC cell line which harbors the EML4-ALK variant 3a/3b. SCID mice xenografted with H2228 were treated for 14 days with crizotinib (100 mg/kg) or ceritinib (25 or 50 mg/kg). All treatments caused tumor regression, but tumors recurred within 11 days after crizotinib treatment withdrawal. 4/8 mice treated with 25 mg/kg ceritinib showed regrowth after 1 month treatment withdrawal. The remaining 4/8 mice treated at 25 mg/kg ceritinib, and all mice treated at 50 mg/kg ceritinib maintained complete remission for four months. While 100 mg/kg crizotinib in mice approximates levels 3-5 times the maximal tolerated dose in humans, the authors state 25 to 50 mg/kg ceritinib in mice is predicted to approximate tolerable doses in humans.",
      "Exon-array and RT-PCR was used to screen a panel of 83 NSCLC cell lines for EML4-ALK variants. The cell lines NCI-H3122 (containing EML4-ALK variant 1) and NCI-H2228 (containing the EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20 fusion-variant 3a/3b) were identified. TAE684 (0.1uM) appreciably inhibited growth as well as Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in variant 1 containing H3122 cells. However, incomplete inhibition in 3a/3b containing H2228 cells was observed. H2228 growth inhibition by TAE684 was more similar to NSCLC cell lines harboring KRAS and EGFR mutations.",
      "In a cohort of 75 NSCLC patients that had tested positive for 3 EML4-ALK rearrangements, two individuals were identified via RT-PCR with a novel EML4-ALK translocation involving the first 6 exons of EML4 fused to the kinase domain of ALK. Genomic PCR resolved a single breakpoint, but 2 variants of the fusion were observed in cells. Variant 3a consisted of fusion at EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20, while variant 3b fused a 33 bp intronic EML4 region between EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20.  3a and 3b showed strong in-vitro kinase activity, transformed mouse 3T3 cells, and 3b-transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors in 8/8 nude mice.  The ALK inhibitor 2,4-pyrimidinediamine inhibited growth of the 3a/b containing NCI-H2228 NSCLC cell line.  The results indicate that 3a/b is a targetable driver-mutation as other EML4-ALK variants.",
      "In a panel of 602 cancer cell lines, 3/134 NSCLC cell lines showed <0.5% cell viability following treatment with the ALK inhibitor TAE684. Of these, NCI-H2228 harbored EML4-ALK variant 3a/b (EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20). TAE684 inhibited Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in H2228 cells and appeared to induce a cytostatic response.",
      "In a set of 31 patients with NSCLC, RT-PCR was performed to test for known EML4-ALK variants.  Five patients tested positive for the 3a/3b EML4-ALK variant.  Of these, 4 had partial response (PR), and one had disease progression (DP), and this was the only DP in the group of 31.  In contrast, of the 13 testing positive for EML4-ALK variant 1, 12 showed PR, and 1 showed stable disease.  These results potentially mirror findings in the H2228 3a/3b containing NSCLC cell line where some literature indicates it does respond as strongly to ALK inhibition as other EML4-ALK NSCLC cell lines.",
      "Transduction of Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK variant 3a caused the cells to grow independently of IL3 addition.  While incubation of Ba/F3 cells transduced with EML4-ALK variants 1 and 2 with Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG caused cell death that was reversible with IL3 addition, Ba/F3 cells with variant 3a were not sensitized to 17-DMAG induced death, suggesting that 17-DMAG was effecting the EML4-ALK driver of IL3-independant proliferation. This in turn suggests that variant 3a may not rely on Hsp90 for stability in cancer cells to the extent of other variants."

      "A retroviral cDNA expression library was constructed using a lung adenocarcinoma specimen from a 67 year old NSCLC patient, and transfected into mouse 3T3 fibroblasts which were assessed for transformed foci.  Analysis of clones from one transformed focus yielded a novel fusion. This fusion generated a protein with N-terminal consisting of EML4 exons 1-13 and C-terminal consisting of ALK exons 20-29, which comprise the intracellular kinase domain of ALK. In subsequent experiments using EML4-ALK or altered versions, the transforming potential of EML4-ALK was found to be dependent on a functional ALK kinase activity as well as the EML4 basic domain, which was shown to have an important role in EML4-ALK dimer formation.  BA/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK were able to grow independently of IL3 addition, but addition of ALK inhibitor WHI-P154 induced cell death and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of EML4-ALK. These results indicated that EML4-ALK may be a driver mutation in NSCLC,  and a target for ALK inhibitor treatment.",
      "EML4-ALK variant 1 containing H-3122 NSCLC cells were treated with second generation ALK inhibitor PF-06463922. PF-06463922 was 125x more potent at reducing cell viability than crizotinib. Control neuroblastoma cell lines with wild-type ALK did not show inhibition below 3800 nM with either drug. At values of 10 and 100 nM, PF-06463922 showed increased ability to inhibit ALK 1278 tyrosine phosphorylation in H3122 cells.",
      "In preclinical work using H3122 NSCLC cells which contain the EML4-ALK variant 1, administration of the Hsp90 inhibitor IPI-504 caused marked decrease of EML4-ALK protein levels at concentrations lower than those used to knock down protein levels of drivers such as HER2 or EGFR in other cell lines, making it the most sensitive Hsp90 client protein the authors had encountered.  IPI-504 treatment caused regression of H3122 tumors in nude mice, whereas Hsp90 inhibitors usually only cause growth inhibition in these models.  Combined treatment of these mice with IPI-504 and crizotinib caused an even stronger tumor regression.",
      "In the PROFILE 1001 study of crizotinib in 82 patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC, 31 patients with sufficient tumor material were tested using RT-PCR for the presence of certain EML4-ALK variants.  13/31 tested patients had the EML4-ALK variant 1. Of these, 12/13 had a partial response, and 1 had stable disease. This response rate of 92% is in contrast to the 57% response rate in the overall patient population, but the numbers of patients with specific EML4-ALK breakpoints were insufficient to correlate with patient response rate.",
      "Transduction of Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK variant 1 causes IL3 independent growth. Incubation of EML4-ALK variant 1 transduced Ba/F3 cells with Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG caused cell death that was reversible with IL3 addition, suggesting that 17-DMAG was effecting the EML4-ALK driver of IL3-independant proliferation, and that EML4-ALK variant 1 is a client protein of Hsp90. The degree of Hsp90 dependence, and targetability of EML4-ALK for Hsp90 inhibition, may vary among ALK fusion variants.  Addition of crizotinib to 17-DMAG caused synergistic death effects, suggesting potential clinical benefit for this inhibitor combination in targeting EML4-ALK variant 1."

Break-apart FISH showed ALK rearrangement, and immunohistochemical staining was characteristic of RANBP2 rearrangement. After further chemotherapy along with maintenance imatinib, crizotinib was started at 200mg twice daily, and a maximal partial response was achieved 5 months later, with regrowth occurring 2 months later. After further surgery, crizotinib was restarted at 250mg twice daily and almost 2 years later the patient was in complete radiographic remission. Another patient with non-ALK rearranged IMT was administered crizotinib in this study but did not respond."

Liver tumor biopsy was taken and estimated to be 15% tumor. Hybrid capture next generation sequencing was performed and an I1171N mutation was found in rearranged ALK, and estimated to be in 33% of the tumor cells. Ceritinib was given at 750 mg once daily but dose reduction to 600 mg once daily was required due to persistent nausea. CT showed regression of liver lesions and primary lung lesion and ongoing response was seen at 3 months.",

She was treated with crizotinib at 250 mg twice daily but discontinued due to adverse response. She then started alectinib at 600 mg twice daily with partial response, but new liver metastases then formed at 5 months. Liver tumor biopsy was performed and was estimated to be 15% tumor tissue. Next-generation sequencing discovered an ALK I1171N mutation. The tumor was not sequenced prior to alectinib resistance.",
      "Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK variant 3 with ALK I1171T mutation were treated with ceritinib, and survival IC50 of 2.6 nM was observed, which compares favorably with highly ceritinib sensitive EML4-ALK wild-type variant 1 survival IC50 of 1.7 nM reported from parallel experiments. Tumors from mice with EML4-ALK variant 3 H2228 NSCLC cell xenografts which had progressed after approximately 40 days of crizotinib treatment were sequenced for ALK mutations.

Treatment of these mouse xenograft models with ceritinib reduced tumor volume to zero, while in contrast tumor size increased with crizotinib treatment.",

Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK I1171T in Ba/F3 cells made these cells moderately resistant to crizotinib and resistant to alectinib. In contrast, the frequently used tool compound TAE684 was equally effective against EML4-ALK wild-type and I1171T, causing cell death at 1000x lower concentration then in unaltered Ba/F3 cells supplemented with IL3.",
      "The I1171T mutation in ALK fusions was found in a NSCLC patient shown positive for ALK rearrangement via break apart FISH assay, who progressed after 8 months of crizotinib, and then progressed again after 4 months of alectinib. The MGH056-1 cell line was derived from this patient, and this cell line was resistant to alectinib. Sequencing of MGH056-1 cells revealed the I1171T mutation in ALK. In cell culture studies Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK I1171T required more that 10x the concentration of alectinib to significantly reduce viability that was required for EML4-ALK wild-type expressing cells. Computer simulation studies indicated that the I1171T mutation interfered with alectinib binding at the ALK active site.",

MGH056-1 cells were resistant to crizotinib (IC50 236nmol/L; aproximately 50x higher than for ceritinib). About 50 fold higher concentration of crizotinib was required to inhibit Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4 ALK I1171T than was required for EML4 ALK wild-type.",

Further testing of this mutation in BaF3 cells revealed that cells expressing EML4-ALk with I1171T mutation required 10x higher concentration to induce cell death than BaF3 cells with wild-type EML4-ALK. In contrast, ceritinib caused loss of viability in EML4-ALK wild-type and I1171T BaF3 cells at comparable concentrations. Ceritinib was also effective at killing MGH056-1 cells that were resistant to alectinib, and reduced Akt and ERK phosphorylation in these cells. Finally, administration of ceritinib to the crizotinib and alectinib resistant patient let to tumor regression and partial response lasting 7 months."

He began showing signs of progression after 3.6 months of lorlatinib treatment and plasma NGS at that time identified a third concurrent acquired resistance mutation G1202R (AF=3.07%) in cis with L1196M."

      "A 21 year old male presented with lymphadenopathy and a low density mass in pancreas. Histopathological analysis showed diffuse tumor cell infiltrate (CD20/EMA negative) with cytoplasmic ALK. RT-PCR indicated CLTC-ALK fusion. The patient was diagnosed with splenic ALK + diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Stage III, Group A with an IPI of 3. CHOP-21 chemotherapy regimen was administered with improvement in abdominal lymph nodes but worsening in retroperitoneal lymph nodes assessed via standardized uptake values. Subsequent ICE chemotherapy regiment relieved some symptoms prompting the patient to refuse further treatment despite other indications of disease progression. Therapy was reinstated after worsening of disease. GEMOX chemotherapy was administered with dexamethasone and 250mg crizotinib twice daily resulting in symptom relief, decreased lymphadenopathy and LDH decline. The disease then progressed and the patient died 2 months after crizotinib initiation. The authors conclude that partial response to crizotinib was observed and that in future trials ALK rearranged DLBCL patients might see increased benefit with earlier application of targeted therapy during the treatment course.",
      "A cell line called LM1 was established from the bone marrow of a 13 year old female patient with relapsed CLTC-ALK positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The patient had been heavily treated with chemotherapy before establishment of the cell line. The cell line maintained the tumor immunophenotype.  SNP analysis of patient bone marrow mononuclear cells and LM1 showed chromosomal changes associated with the cell line but 94.7% of SNPs were identically called.  ALK kinase inhibitor TAE684 induced cell death in LM1 cells at low nanomolar concentrations, while it did not significantly effect the ALK-rearrangement negative DLBCL cell line Karpas422.  LM1 cells formed tumors in 3/10 SCID and 9/10 NOD-SCID mice.  CD30 and CD138 immmunostaining were maintained between original tumor and LM1 xenografts. In mice, LM1 but not Karpas422 xenografts regressed with TAE684 administration, and complete remission for 13 weeks was observed before experiment was terminated."

He tested positive for ALK rearrangement via break apart FISH assay, and started crizotinib with near complete response for 27 months. Progression then occurred and biopsy of a pleural nodule was performed with hybrid-capture NGS. EML4-ALK variant 3 with F1245C mutation was found with allele frequency of 2% and tumor purity 13%. Due to slow progression and low tumor burden crizotinib was maintained for additional 8 months, and then he was transitioned onto ceritinib at 750 mg daily. After 3 months ceritinib, complete radiographic response was seen and the patient was without evidence of disease at 6 months. Dose was reduced to 600 mg ceritinib daily due to gastrointestinal side effects.",
      "A 52 year old with a non-smoking history was diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC-adenocarcinoma and treated with chemotherapy.  Upon disease progression, the initial diagnostic biopsy tested positive for ALK-rearrangement using break apart FISH, but the ALK fusion was not sequenced for mutations. Break-apart signal was positive in 66% of tumor cells. Crizotinib was initiated and a sustained near complete response for 27 months was observed, after which an FDG-avid cervical lymph node appeared along with pleural effusions and pleural nodules. A pleural nodule was biopsied and profiled using hybrid-capture next generation sequencing, and revealed EML4-ALK variant 3 with F1245C mutation at mutant allele frequency of 2% and tumor purity of 13%. Crizotinib was maintained for 8 additional months due to low tumor burden and slow progression."

After 1 month of therapy the patient showed clinical improvement, and plasma NGS revealed a decrease in EML4::ALK allele fraction (AF) from 24.21% to 8.22%. Progressive disease was confirmed after 4.5 months of alectinib therapy at which time plasma NGS revealed the emergence of two acquired resistance mutations, I1171N (AF=4.24%) and L1196M (AF=0.33). He then received lorlatinib and achieved a PR within one month with 34% tumour shrinkage. He began showing signs of progression after 3.6 months of lorlatinib treatment. Plasma NGS at that time identified a third concurrent acquired resistance mutation G1202R (AF=3.07%) in cis with L1196M, suggesting the combination of concurrent I1171N, L1196M, and G1202R were responsible for acquired resistance to lorlatinib."

      "EML4-ALK fusions occur in 2-7% of lung adenocarcinomas. Transduction of Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) caused the cells to grow independently of IL3 addition.  EML4-ALK may be a client protein of Hsp90. Addition of Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG to the EML4-ALK variant 2 cells induced cell death which was rescued at lower 17-DMAG concentrations by IL3 addition. This result suggests that 17-DMAG specifically  targeted the EML4-ALK driver in these cells. Finally, 17-DMAG and crizotinib showed a synergistic effect in killing EML4-ALK variant 2 cells.",
      "EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) were expressed in Ba/F3 cells using retrovirus.  While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate.  While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity.  Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.",
      "In the PROFILE 1001 study, from 31 NSCLC tumors positive for ALK fusions with sufficient material for RT-PCR aided exon breakpoint identification, 1 case of EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) was found. This patient had adenocarcinoma and a 9 pack year smoking history. Crizotinib treatment duration was over 16 weeks. The patient had multiple lines of prior treatment and showed a partial response to first-time crizotinib treatment. Overall, in the 82 ALK positive patients treated in the study, 46 had partial responses (including this patient) and 1 had a complete response for an overall response rate of 57%."

ALK rearrangement was determined by FISH, but the ALK fusion partner was not determined due to limited tissue. The patient underwent treatment with CHOP chemotherapy regimen and radiation but did not respond. The patient progressed following salvage chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. Crizotinib was then administered at 250 mg twice daily, and LDH levels rapidly dropped along with disappearance of palpable lymphadenopathy, but progression ensued after 21 days and the patient died soon after. The authors attribute the short response to crizotinib to the possibility of this tumor having an ALK fusion variant less responsive to ALK inhibition and to a high Ki-67 index in the patient, and deem that despite the brief response, crizotinib shows promise in ALK rearranged DLBCL."

      "A 31 year old male initially thought to have a mandibular osteosarcoma that was resected and treated with adjuvant radiation and cisplatin-doxorubicin. He had a mandibular recurrence with multiple pulmonary nodules 12 months after diagnosis, at which point he underwent whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing of their lesion. In both RNA and DNA, an in-frame deletion of exons 2-18 of ALK which retains the kinase domain and leads to activation as well as a FUS::TFCP2 fusion resulting from a rearrangements between FUS intron 6 (exons 1-6) and TFCP2 intron 1 (exons 2-15) were identified. His cancer progressed following ifosfamide-etoposide chemotherapy and then after radiation with regorafenib, leading to hypoxic respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation. Compassionate use of alectinib was then given, resulting in dramatic clinical improvement within 48 hours, allowing him to stop ventilation. By 2 weeks there was radiological evidence of response. After 3 weeks there was new evidence of subcutaneous metastasis and pericardial involvement. The patient died of his disease 4 weeks after starting alectinib. The authors posit that this is still evidence of response but this was short lived due to the aggressiveness of the tumor and it's advanced stage at the time of treatment."

The IC50 for brigatinib against EML4-ALK wild-type was 0.95, which is about 3x higher than the IC50 that was observed for alectinib, but about 6x lower than that for crizotinib.

A V1180L missense mutation was found in the kinase domain of ALK in H3122 CHR-A1 cells. Both H3122 and H3122 CHR-A1 cells were highly and equally sensitive to ceritinib induced death. In Ba/F3 cells, ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L rendered cells significantly more sensitive to ceritinib than Ba/F3 containing EML4-ALK I1171T mutant (alectinib and crizotinib resistant) or EML4-ALK wt.",
      "The EML4 ALK variant 1 containing NSCLC cell line H3122 is highly sensitive to alectinib, and an alectinib resistant derivative cell line H3122 CHR-A1 was generated by incubation of H3122 in increasing levels of alectinib culminating in 1 micro-molar, over a course of 7 months. The ALK kinase domain mutation V1180L was found in these cells, and Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4 ALK  V1180L were highly resistant to alectinib. Simulations indicated that the V1180L mutation interfered with alectinib binding. The V1180L mutation was found to be more resistant to alectinib than the I1171T mutation found in an ALK-positive NSCLC patient who developed alectinib resistance on lower dose alectinib  (300mg twice daily).",
      "The V1180L mutation in the kinase domain of rearranged ALK was found in an alectinib resistant cell line named H3122 CHR-A1, which was derived from the alectinib sensitive EML4-ALK variant 1 containing NSCLC cell line H3122 by passaging into higher concentrations of alectinib. This cell line is a model for gain of alectinib resistance, and also shows resistance to crizotinib. On the other hand, the often used tool ALK inhibitor TAE684 was highly effective in killing H3122 CHR-A1, where H3122 cells were only slightly more sensitized to TAE684-induced cell death. Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L in Ba/F3 cells caused IL3 independent growth as well as marked sensitization to TAE684, to a level greater than that seen in EML4-ALK I1171T (alectinib resistance mutation) or EML4-ALK wt, and over 1000x greater sensitivity than unaltered Ba/F3 + IL3.",
      "The alectinib resistant cell line H3122 CHR-A1 was generated by culturing of the EML4-ALK (variant 1) containing cell line H3122 with increasing levels of alectinib. Molecular characterization of H3122 CHR-A1 revealed a V1180L ALK kinase domain mutation. The H3122 CHR-A1 cell line required approximately 10 fold increase in crizotinib concentration to induce similar levels of cell death to H3122. Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L rendered Ba/F3 cells moderately less susceptible to crizotinib than ectopic EML4-ALK."

Brigatinib reduced CLB-BAR cellular proliferation more effectively than crizotinib (IC50 75.2 vs 186.4nM). CLB-BAR xenografts in BalbC/NUDE mice responded to brigatinib with reduced tumor volume and weight (N=8/group) as well as reduced ALK phosphorylation and MYCN levels compared to untreated controls. Release of brigatinib administration at day 15 resulted in tumor growth (N=2)."

      "In Ba/F3 cells, crizotinib sensitivty of the NPM-ALK variant was compared to crizotinib sensitivity of EML4-ALK variant 3. 50% of maximal inhibitory concentration for NPM-ALK was 42 nM, which was approximately 4x greater than IC50 of 11 nM obtained for EML4-ALK. The IC50 for parental Ba/F3 supplemented with IL3 was 2299 nM, resulting in a fold difference of 209.2 for EML4-ALK and 55.1 for NPM-ALK, indicating some reduced sensitivity for NPM-ALK in direct comparison to EML4-ALK, but substantial sensitization to crizotinib for NPM-ALK in Ba/F3 cells."

      "Multiplex RT-PCR to detect in-frame fusions of EML4 to ALK was performed on total RNA from 253 lung adenocarcinomas, and 9 samples were found to contain such fusions, one of which was a novel fusion containing EML4 exon 2 and exon 20 of ALK. This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.  These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib."

One sample showed potential rearrangement and RT-PCR demonstrated an EML4-ALK fusion where EML4 exon 21 was fused to ALK exon 13. This EML4-ALK variant is different from those commonly found in NSCLC. Genomic PCR verified the existence of the fusion breakpoint in intronic space, indicating that some colorectal adenocarcinoma may have targetable ALK-fusion driver mutations."

A computational method was used to find potential gene fusions which assessed differential exon expression between the 3' and 5' ends of each gene. Two potential fusions were found and assessed using RNA ligase mediated rapid amplifiation of cDNA ends and RT-PCR. The fusions were EML4-ALK variants 1 and 2. Genomic PCR identified fusion breakpoints, and these differed from breakpoints for these EML4-ALK variants reported in NSCLC."
